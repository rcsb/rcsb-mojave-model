# RCSB-JSON-SCHEMA
The repository is a schema store that hosts [JSON Schemas](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html)
for RCSB data models!

### Versioning
Versioning of schema files is handled by adding a tag to a specific commit in the repositoryâ€™s history referring
to a release point. Version numbers should follow [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver)
(SemVer). Release version takes the **x.y.z** form, where **x** is the major version, **y** is the minor version,
and **z** is the patch version (e.g. 0.1.0). Pre-release versions are denoted by appending a hyphen and a series
of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version (e.g. 1.0.0-3.7, 1.0.0-alpha.3.7, 1.0.0-dev.3.7).

Given a version number **major.minor.patch**, increment the:

- **major** version when changes are incompatible (removing fields, changing fields name or type) with previous version,
- **minor** version when changes are backwards-compatible (adding new fields), and
- **patch** version when changes are backwards-compatible and related to metadata (changing field description, adding examples, etc.).

## Schema Sources
This project has 2 types of schema sources:
- `schemas/exchange` - automatically generated JSON Schema files that contain definitions for data items that are coming 
from the Exchange DB. Those files are not sources and should not be updated directly. The definitions need to be updated 
in the [py-rcsb_exdb_assets](https://github.com/rcsb/py-rcsb_exdb_assets) repository, JSON Schema files need to be 
generated and pushed to this project
- `schemas/internal` - manually curated JSON Schema files that contain definitions for data items that are NOT coming 
from the Exchange DB. If changes are needed for those definitions, they should be done to the files in this folder 
directly

### Distribution
As a part of CI/CD process, the source schemas will be pushed to the [Nexus Repository](http://nexus3.rcsb.org/#browse/browse:rcsb-super-proxy:org%2Frcsb%2Frcsb-json-schema).

### Cardinal Identifier Containers
Cardinal identifier containers provide evidence about how the data described by core schemas are related.
In each core you can find a container specific to core:
 - `rcsb_assembly_container_identifiers` for assembly core
 - `rcsb_entry_container_identifiers` for entry core
 - `rcsb_polymer_entity_container_identifiers` for entity core
 - `rcsb_uniprot_container_identifiers` for uniprot core

The content of these containers are pointers to the entries in related cores.

### Schema Integration Rules
As we integrate multiple sources into a single schema, we want to ensure that the original schema is preserved
as closely as possible. However, it may be necessary to change the original schema. When this happens a new or modified
data item is appended to the original schema under `rcsb_` namespace to indicate provenance. Here is a set of rules that
govern schema integration:
  - Data mutation (e.g. changing or adding new value) should be added as a new `rcsb_` item.
  - Data aggregation (e.g. merging multiple original data items in a new object) should be added as a new `rcsb_` item.
  - Data reduction (e.g. filtering of array) should be added as a new `rcsb_` item.
  - Schema reduction (e.g. removing fields from original data item) should be integrated with original schema.
